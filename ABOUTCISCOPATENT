Mr Hertrick:

The following is Cisco's policy with respect to VRRP:


Cisco will not assert any patents owned or controlled by Cisco  against any
party  for making, using, selling, importing or offering for sale a product
that implements IETF RFC 2338, provided, however that:

Cisco retains the right to assert its patents  (including the right to claim
past royalties) against any party that asserts a patent it owns or controls
(either directly or indirectly) against Cisco or any of Cisco's affiliates
or successors in title; and Cisco retains the right to assert its patents
against any product or portion
thereof that is not necessary for compliance with RFC 2338.

If you have any questions, or if you would prefer a royalty-bearing license,
please contact me.

This is our policy for RFC2338. If VRRP v.2 and/or v.3 become
standards-track RFC's (have they?) then this policy applies to those as
well:



Cisco will not assert any patents owned or controlled by Cisco against any
party for making, using, selling, importing or offering for sale a product
that implements IETF RFC 2338, provided, however that:
Cisco retains the right to assert its patents (including the right to claim
past royalties) against any party that asserts a patent it owns or controls
(either directly or indirectly) against Cisco or any of Cisco's affiliates
or successors in title; and Cisco retains the right to assert its patents
against any product or portion thereof that is not necessary for compliance with RFC 2338.
If you have any questions, or if you would prefer a royalty-bearing license
please contact me.

Subject: Patent issue for VRRPv2 and VRRPv3


Dear Robert Barr,

In order to be conform to the Cisco standards concerning VRRPv2 and VRRPv3
(Patent #5 473 599),  I would like to obtain a legal authorization from
Cisco to implement and use these protocols in OpenSource system environment, so
be conform and compatible between all the existant equipments. OpenSource
systems are not a risk for your company and will profit to network standards. If
you cannot give me an  authorization, other solutions will be done and will be
incompatible with your VRRP standard (like CARP a Common Adress
Redundancy Protocol coming soon under OpenBSD 3.5)
In order to continue my work in the OpenSource domain, can you tell me
if you can give me an authorization for implementing and using VRRPv2,
VRRPv3 ietf standard in a free opensource software (no selling) ?
Is there any parts to request for that same thing ?

Regards,
Sebastien Petit
