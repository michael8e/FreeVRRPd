FreeVRRPd is a BSD licensed version of the Virtual Router Reduncacy
Protoocol (RFCs 2338, 3768 and 5798) which implements both version 2
and version 3 of the protocol.

This software based on the original work by Sebastien Petit which covered
only Version 2 of the protocol but is now being actively updated to
conform to the latest standards.

Portions of this software were developed with support from
Rubicon Communications, LLC (Netgate).
